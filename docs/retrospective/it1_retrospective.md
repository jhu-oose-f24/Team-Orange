## What Went Well:
- Division of Labor. Each member of the team contributed to the overall project. Dylan set up the react project for the frontend. Rayna set up the Node backend project. Dylan and Jackson worked on the frontend UI. Matthew and Rayna worked on the backend API and set up the postgresql database. John and Brian worked on the SRS and UML diagrams. These roles will remain semi-consistent in future iterations, but they are also open to fluidity as each member is set up and well-versed in each aspect of our project. 
- Communication: We communicated well about deadlines and progress on PR's over our internal slack channel. Members would send messages when they were finished on an issue or otherwise give tentative deadlines for when PR's could be expected. 
- PR Review: PR's were reviews in a timely manner to help each member understand components of the project which they did not directly work on and give feedback for teh authors. 

## What Could be Improved:
- (nit) Getting each member connected to the db took some time. We are each successfully able run the db now, but this could have been streamlined better. 
- Not much else. Team is working well. Lets keep it up!

## What Has Been Delivered:
- We have successfully scaffolded our project frontend and backend. 
- We have successfully initiated the Postgresql databse and have USER and TICKET entities with relevent attributes such as name, description, deadline, role, etc. 
- The backend API connects to the dabase and get make POST and GET requests the the tickets endpoint.
- The frontend is integrated with the backed so FE actions update the (local) db through the BE API. 

## What We Have Not Yet Delivered:
- API PUT and DETELE
- user login, JSWebToken
- multiple FE feeds (ToDo, InProgress, Done)
- ticket search, filtering (FE/BE)
- myTickets FE view
- FE usability updates
- (tentativly exploe FE packages for cohesive development and UX)
