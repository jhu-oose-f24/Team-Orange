# Setting Up the PostgreSQL Database

Install PostgreSQL using your preferred package manager. On macOS, you can install it with Homebrew:
```
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```
For other operating systems, follow the instructions on the official PostgreSQL website.

Open a psql session to create a new PostgreSQL user and database.
Run the following commands to create a new user (replace your_username with your preferred username) and set a password for the user:
```
psql postgres
CREATE USER your_username WITH SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE PASSWORD 'your_password';
CREATE DATABASE your_db_name OWNER your_username;
```
Exit psql by typing \q.

Open the projectâ€™s backend/src/database.json file and update the database connection details. 

Navigate to the backend/src directory and install the required database migration tools:
```
npm install -g db-migrate
npm install -g db-migrate-pg
```
Run the database migrations to initialize the database:
```
db-migrate up initialize
```
Your PostgreSQL database is now set up and ready to be used with the backend of the project.
